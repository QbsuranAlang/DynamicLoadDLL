This is the class "dld : dynamic load dll" Documentation.

File : 
	dld.cs is the body class.
	CV.cs is use to show how to use the dld class.
	dll folder is use to show how to export a dll in C++.

The most important part of dll is the "Entry Point", 
you can use the command line tools : "dumpbin" in visual C++ to inquire the entry point.


In cpp file, if you want to export to C#, you should be export to _stdcall. If you want to export to C or C++,
you should be export to _cdecl(and you can use LoadLibrary API).
